# Python Learning Plan
Goal: Reach the top 10% of Python programmers worldwide in the next few years.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations (0–3 months) ✅ Completed (PCEP Certified)
- Variables, data types, input/output
- Control flow: if/elif/else
- Loops: for, while
- Collections: list, tuple, set, dict
- Functions: definition, parameters, return values
- Error handling with try/except
- Writing clean code (PEP-8)

**Outcome:** Achieved – confirmed by PCEP certification.

---

## Phase 2: Intermediate Programming (3–6 months) 🚧 In Progress (PCAP)
- File handling (read/write, CSV, JSON)
- List/dict comprehensions
- Modules and packages
- Virtual environments and package management (pip, venv/poetry)
- Basic testing with `unittest` or `pytest`
- Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP)

**Expected outcome:** Ability to build medium-sized projects and organize code into reusable components.  
**Current status:** Studying and working towards PCAP certification.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Topics (6–12 months)
- Deep OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes)
- Iterators, generators, decorators
- Error hierarchy and custom exceptions
- Context managers
- Regular expressions
- Performance considerations (profiling, big-O basics)

**Expected outcome:** Ability to design efficient, maintainable programs with advanced Python features.

---

## Phase 4: Applied Python (1–2 years)
- Web development (Flask/FastAPI/Django basics)
- Data analysis with pandas, numpy
- Plotting and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn/plotly)
- Databases (SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy)
- Working with APIs (requests, REST basics)
- Automation and scripting

**Expected outcome:** Ability to use Python in real-world domains like web apps, data analysis, and automation.

---

## Phase 5: Mastery (2+ years)
- Design patterns in Python
- Concurrency & parallelism (threading, asyncio, multiprocessing)
- Advanced testing & CI/CD
- Type hinting & static analysis (mypy, pylint)
- Open-source contribution
- Large-scale architecture (microservices, distributed systems basics)

**Expected outcome:** Capable of working on complex, large-scale projects at professional level.

---

## Progress Tracking
- Daily logs stored in `logs/` folder
- Code samples stored in `code/`
- Progress overview updated in `README.md`

---

## Notes
- Always follow PEP-8 and good coding practices
- Focus on building projects along the way, not just theory
- Regularly revisit and refine this plan
